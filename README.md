# OOP Programs with C++

## Overview

This repository showcases a collection of C++ programs developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Each program is designed to demonstrate fundamental OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into daily folders, each representing a set of programs or exercises:

* `Day_1` to `Day_7`: Contains C++ programs focused on specific OOP topics covered each day.

## Features

* **Modular Code**: Each program is self-contained, focusing on a particular OOP concept.
* **Progressive Learning**: The daily structure allows for step-by-step learning and practice.
* **Clean Codebase**: Emphasis on readable and maintainable code.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the programs:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdelrhmanMohamed0/OOP_PROGRAMS_WITH_CPP.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired day's folder:

   ```bash
   cd OOP_PROGRAMS_WITH_CPP/Day_1
   ```

3. Compile the C++ program using a compiler like `g++`:

   ```bash
   g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
   ```

4. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

*Replace `program_name.cpp` with the actual file name.*
